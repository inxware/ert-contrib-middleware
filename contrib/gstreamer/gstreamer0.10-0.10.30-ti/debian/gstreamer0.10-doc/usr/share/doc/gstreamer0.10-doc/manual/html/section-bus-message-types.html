><P
>&#13;      <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>GStreamer</SPAN
> has a few pre-defined message types that can be passed
      over the bus. The messages are extensible, however. Plug-ins can
      define additional messages, and applications can decide to either
      have specific code for those or ignore them. All applications are
      strongly recommended to at least handle error messages by providing
      visual feedback to the user.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      All messages have a message source, type and timestamp. The message
      source can be used to see which element emitted the message. For some
      messages, for example, only the ones emitted by the top-level pipeline
      will be interesting to most applications (e.g. for state-change
      notifications). Below is a list of all messages and a short explanation
      of what they do and how to parse message-specific content.
    </P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;          Error, warning and information notifications: those are used
          by elements if a message should be shown to the user about the
          state of the pipeline. Error messages are fatal and terminate
          the data-passing. The error should be repaired to resume pipeline
          activity. Warnings are not fatal, but imply a problem nevertheless.
          Information messages are for non-problem notifications. All those
          messages contain a <CODE
CLASS="classname"
>GError</CODE
> with the main
          error type and message, and optionally a debug string. Both
          can be extracted using <CODE
CLASS="function"
>gst_message_parse_error
          ()</CODE
>, <CODE
CLASS="function"
>_parse_warning ()</CODE
> and
          <CODE
CLASS="function"
>_parse_info ()</CODE
>. Both error and debug strings
          should be freed after use.
        </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;          End-of-stream notification: this is emitted when the stream has
          ended. The state of the pipeline will not change, but further
          media handling will stall. Applications can use this to skip to
          the next song in their playlist. After end-of-stream, it is also
          possible to seek back in the stream. Playback will then continue
          automatically. This message has no specific arguments.
        </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;          Tags: emitted when metadata was found in the stream. This can be
          emitted multiple times for a pipeline (e.g. once for descriptive
          metadata such as artist name or song title, and another one for
          stream-information, such as samplerate and bitrate). Applications
          should cache metadata internally. <CODE
CLASS="function"
>gst_message_parse_tag
          ()</CODE
> should be used to parse the taglist, which should
          be <CODE
CLASS="function"
>gst_tag_list_free ()</CODE
>'ed when no longer
          needed.
        </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;          State-changes: emitted after a successful state change.
          <CODE
CLASS="function"
>gst_message_parse_state_changed ()</CODE
> can be
          used to parse the old and new state of this transition.
        </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;          Buffering: emitted during caching of network-streams. One can
          manually extract the progress (in percent) from the message by
          extracting the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"buffer-percent"</SPAN
> property from the
          structure returned by <CODE
CLASS="function"
>gst_message_get_structure
          ()</CODE
>.
        </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;          Element messages: these are special messages that are unique to
          certain elements and usually represent additional features. The
          element's documentation should mention in detail which
          element messages a particular element may send. As an example,
          the 'qtdemux' QuickTime demuxer element may send a 'redirect'
          element message on certain occasions if the stream contains a
          redirect instruction.
        </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;          Application-specific messages: any information on those can
          be extracted by getting the message structure (see above) and
          reading its fields. Usually these messages can safely be ignored.
        </P
><P
>&#13;          Application messages are primarily meant for internal
          use in applications in case the application needs to marshal
          information from some thread into the main thread. This is
          particularly useful when the application is making use of element
          signals (as those signals will be emitted in the context of the
          streaming thread).
