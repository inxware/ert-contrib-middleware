>&#13;    Caps negotiation is the process where elements configure themselves
    and each other for streaming a particular media format over their pads.
    Since different types of elements have different requirements for the
    media formats they can negotiate to, it is important that this process
    is generic and implements all those use cases correctly.
  </P
><P
>&#13;    In this chapter, we will discuss downstream negotiation and upstream
    negotiation from a pipeline perspective, implicating the responsibilities
    of different types of elements in a pipeline, and we will introduce the
    concept of <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I

>.

>&#13;      Let's take the case of a file source, linked to a demuxer, linked to a
      decoder, linked to a converter with a caps filter and finally an audio
      output. When data flow originally starts, the demuxer will parse the
      file header (e.g. the Ogg headers), and notice that there is, for
      example, a Vorbis stream in this Ogg file. Noticing that, it will
      create an output pad for the Vorbis elementary stream and set a
      Vorbis-caps on it. Lastly, it adds the pad. As of this point, the pad
      is ready to be used to stream data, and so the Ogg demuxer is now done.
      This pad is <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>not</I
></SPAN
> re-negotiable, since the type of
      the data stream is embedded within the data.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      The Vorbis decoder will decode the Vorbis headers and the Vorbis data
      coming in on its sinkpad. Now, some decoders may be able to output in
      multiple output formats, for example both 16-bit integer output and
      floating-point output, whereas other decoders may be able to only decode
      into one specific format, e.g. only floating-point (32-bit) audio. Those
      two cases have consequences for how caps negotiation should be
      implemented in this decoder element. In the one case, it is possible to
      use fixed caps, and you're done. In the other case, however, you should
      implement the possibility for <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>renegotiation</I
></SPAN
> in this
      element, which is the possibility for the data format to be changed to
      another format at some point in the future. We will discuss how to do
      this in one of the sections further on in this chapter.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      The filter can be used by applications to force, for example, a specific
      channel configuration (5.1/surround or 2.0/stereo), on the pipeline, so
      that the user can enjoy sound coming from all its speakers. The audio
      sink, in this example, is a standard ALSA output element (alsasink).
      The converter element supports any-to-any, and the filter will make sure
      that only a specifically wanted channel configuration streams through
      this link (as provided by the user's channel configuration preference).
      By changing this preference while the pipeline is running, some elements
      will have to renegotiate <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>while the pipeline is
      running</I
></SPAN
>. This is done through upstream caps renegotiation.
      That, too, will be discussed in detail in a section further below.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      In order for caps negotiation on non-fixed links to work correctly,
      pads can optionally implement a function that tells peer elements what
      formats it supports and/or prefers. When upstream renegotiation is
      triggered, this becomes important.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Downstream elements are notified of a newly set caps only when data
      is actually passing their pad. This is because caps is attached to
      buffers during data flow. So when the vorbis decoder sets a caps on
      its source pad (to configure the output format), the converter will
      not yet be notified. Instead, the converter will only be notified
      when the decoder pushes a buffer over its source pad to the converter.
      Right before calling the chain-function in the converter, <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>GStreamer</SPAN
>
      will check whether the format that was previously negotiated still
      applies to this buffer. If not, it first calls the setcaps-function
      of the converter to configure it for the new format. Only after that
      will it call the chain function of the converter.
