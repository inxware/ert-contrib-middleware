>&#13;    Previously, in the chapter <A
HREF="chapter-building-args.html"
>Adding Arguments</A
>, we have
    introduced the concept of GObject properties of controlling an element's
    behaviour. This is very powerful, but it has two big disadvantages:
    first of all, it is too generic, and second, it isn't dynamic.
  </P
><P
>&#13;    The first disadvantage is related to the customizability of the end-user
    interface that will be built to control the element. Some properties are
    more important than others. Some integer properties are better shown in a
    spin-button widget, whereas others would be better represented by a slider
    widget. Such things are not possible because the UI has no actual meaning
    in the application. A UI widget that represents a bitrate property is the
    same as a UI widget that represents the size of a video, as long as both
    are of the same <CODE
CLASS="classname"
>GParamSpec</CODE
> type. Another problem,
    is that things like parameter grouping, function grouping, or parameter
    coupling are not
    really possible.
  </P
><P
>&#13;    The second problem with parameters are that they are not dynamic. In
    many cases, the allowed values for a property are not fixed, but depend
    on things that can only be detected at runtime. The names of inputs for
    a TV card in a video4linux source element, for example, can only be
    retrieved from the kernel driver when we've opened the device; this only
    happens when the element goes into the READY state. This means that we
    cannot create an enum property type to show this to the user.
  </P
><P
>&#13;    The solution to those problems is to create very specialized types of
    controls for certain often-used controls. We use the concept of interfaces
    to achieve this. The basis of this all is the glib
    <CODE
CLASS="classname"
>GTypeInterface</CODE
> type. For each case where we think
    it's useful, we've created interfaces which can be implemented by elements
    at their own will. We've also created a small extension to
    <CODE
CLASS="classname"
>GTypeInterface</CODE
> (which is static itself, too) which
    allows us to query for interface availability based on runtime properties.
    This extension is called <A
HREF="../../gstreamer/html/GstImplementsInterface.html"
TARGET="_top"
><CODE
CLASS="classname"
>&#13;    GstImplementsInterface</CODE
></A
>.
  </P
><P
>&#13;    One important note: interfaces do <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>not</I
></SPAN
> replace
    properties. Rather, interfaces should be built <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>next to</I
></SPAN
>
    properties. There are two important reasons for this. First of all, 
    properties
    can be saved in XML files. Second, properties can be specified on the
    commandline (<TT
CLASS="filename"
>gst-launch</TT
>).

><P
>&#13;      Implementing interfaces is initiated in the <CODE
CLASS="function"
>_get_type ()</CODE
>
      of your element. You can register one or more interfaces after having
      registered the type itself. Some interfaces have dependencies on other
      interfaces or can only be registered by certain types of elements. You
      will be notified of doing that wrongly when using the element: it will
      quit with failed assertions, which will explain what went wrong. In the
      case of GStreamer, the only dependency that <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>some</I
></SPAN
>
      interfaces have is <A
HREF="../../gstreamer/html/GstImplementsInterface.html"
TARGET="_top"
><CODE
CLASS="classname"
>&#13;      GstImplementsInterface</CODE
></A
>. Per
      interface, we will indicate clearly when it depends on this extension.
      If it does, you need to register support for <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>that</I
></SPAN
>
      interface before registering support for the interface that you're
      wanting to support. The example below explains how to add support for a
      simple interface with no further dependencies. For a small explanation
      on <A
