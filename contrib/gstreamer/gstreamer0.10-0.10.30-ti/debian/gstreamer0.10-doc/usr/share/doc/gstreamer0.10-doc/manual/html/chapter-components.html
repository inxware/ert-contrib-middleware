>&#13;    <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>GStreamer</SPAN
> includes several higher-level components to simplify an
    application developer's life. All of the components discussed here (for now) are
    targetted at media playback. The idea of each of these components is
    to integrate as closely as possible with a <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>GStreamer</SPAN
> pipeline, but
    to hide the complexity of media type detection and several other
    rather complex topics that have been discussed in <A

>&#13;    We currently recommend people to use either playbin (see <A
HREF="chapter-components.html#section-components-playbin"
>Section 19.1</A
>) or decodebin (see <A
HREF="section-components-decodebin.html"
>Section 19.2</A
>), depending on their needs.
    Playbin is the recommended solution for everything related to simple
    playback of media that should just work. Decodebin is a more flexible
    autoplugger that could be used to add more advanced features, such
    as playlist support, crossfading of audio tracks and so on. Its
    programming interface is more low-level than that of playbin, though.

>&#13;      Playbin is an element that can be created using the standard <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>GStreamer</SPAN
>
      API (e.g. <CODE
CLASS="function"
>gst_element_factory_make ()</CODE
>). The factory
      is conveniently called <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"playbin"</SPAN
>. By being a
      <CODE
CLASS="classname"
>GstPipeline</CODE
> (and thus a
      <CODE
CLASS="classname"
>GstElement</CODE
>), playbin automatically supports all
      of the features of this class, including error handling, tag support,
      state handling, getting stream positions, seeking, and so on.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Setting up a playbin pipeline is as simple as creating an instance of
      the playbin element, setting a file location using the
      <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"uri"</SPAN
> property on playbin, and then setting the element
      to the <CODE
CLASS="classname"
>GST_STATE_PLAYING</CODE
> state (the location has to be a valid
      URI, so <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"&#60;protocol&#62;://&#60;location&#62;"</SPAN
>, e.g.
      file:///tmp/my.ogg or http://www.example.org/stream.ogg). Internally,
      playbin will set up a pipeline to playback the media location.
