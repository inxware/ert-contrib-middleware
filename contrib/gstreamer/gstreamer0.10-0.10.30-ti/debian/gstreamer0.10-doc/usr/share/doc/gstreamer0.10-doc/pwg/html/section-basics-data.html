><P
>&#13;            A reference count indicating the number of elements currently
            holding a reference to the buffer. When the buffer reference count
            falls to zero, the buffer will be unlinked, and its memory will be
            freed in some sense (see below for more details).
          </P

    </P
><P
>&#13;      There are two types of data defined: events (control) and buffers
      (content).
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Buffers may contain any sort of data that the two linked pads
      know how to handle. Normally, a buffer contains a chunk of some sort of
      audio or video data that flows from one element to another.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Buffers also contain metadata describing the buffer's contents. Some of
      the important types of metadata are:
      <P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;            A pointer to the buffer's data.
          </P

><P
>&#13;            An integer indicating the size of the buffer's data.
          </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;            A timestamp indicating the preferred display timestamp of the
            content in the buffer.
          </P
></LI
></UL
>
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Events
      contain information on the state of the stream flowing between the two
      linked pads. Events will only be sent if the element explicitly supports
      them, else the core will (try to) handle the events automatically. Events
      are used to indicate, for example, a clock discontinuity, the end of a
      media stream or that the cache should be flushed.
    </P

>&#13;      Events may contain several of the following items:
      <P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;            A subtype indicating the type of the contained event.
          </P

><LI
><P
>&#13;            The other contents of the event depend on the specific event type.

><P
>&#13;      Events will be discussed extensively in <A

      Until then, the only event that will be used is the <SPAN

><P
>&#13;        Buffers are able to store chunks of memory of several different
	types.  The most generic type of buffer contains memory allocated
	by malloc().  Such buffers, although convenient, are not always
	very fast, since data often needs to be specifically copied into
	the buffer.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	Many specialized elements create buffers that point to special
	memory.  For example, the filesrc element usually
	maps a file into the address space of the application (using mmap()),
	and creates buffers that point into that address range.  These
	buffers created by filesrc act exactly like generic buffers, except
	that they are read-only.  The buffer freeing code automatically
	determines the correct method of freeing the underlying memory.
	Downstream elements that receive these kinds of buffers do not
	need to do anything special to handle or unreference it.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        Another way an element might get specialized buffers is to
	request them from a downstream peer.  These are called
	downstream-allocated buffers.  Elements can ask a
	peer connected to a source pad to create an empty buffer of
	a given size.  If a downstream element is able to create a
	special buffer of the correct size, it will do so.  Otherwise
	<SPAN
CLASS="application"
>GStreamer</SPAN
> will automatically create a generic buffer instead.
	The element that requested the buffer can then copy data into
	the buffer, and push the buffer to the source pad it was
	allocated from.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        Many sink elements have accelerated methods for copying data
	to hardware, or have direct access to hardware.  It is common
	for these elements to be able to create downstream-allocated
	buffers for their upstream peers.  One such example is
	ximagesink.  It creates buffers that contain XImages.  Thus,
	when an upstream peer copies data into the buffer, it is copying
	directly into the XImage, enabling ximagesink to draw the
	image directly to the screen instead of having to copy data
	into an XImage first.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        Filter elements often have the opportunity to either work on
	a buffer in-place, or work while copying from a source buffer
	to a destination buffer.  It is optimal to implement both
	algorithms, since the <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>GStreamer</SPAN
> framework can choose the
	fastest algorithm as appropriate.  Naturally, this only makes
	sense for strict filters -- elements that have exactly the
	same format on source and sink pads.
