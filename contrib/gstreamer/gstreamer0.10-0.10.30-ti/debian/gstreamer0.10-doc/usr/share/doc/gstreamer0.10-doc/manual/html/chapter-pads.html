>&#13;    As we have seen in <A
HREF="chapter-elements.html"
>Elements</A
>, the pads are
    the element's interface to the outside world. Data streams from one
    element's source pad to another element's sink pad. The specific
    type of media that the element can handle will be exposed by the
    pad's capabilities. We will talk more on capabilities later in this
    chapter (see <A
HREF="section-caps.html"
>Section 8.2</A

>&#13;      A pad type is defined by two properties: its direction and its
      availability. As we've mentioned before, <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>GStreamer</SPAN
> defines two
      pad directions: source pads and sink pads. This terminology is
      defined from the view of within the element: elements receive data
      on their sink pads and generate data on their source pads.
      Schematically, sink pads are drawn on the left side of an element,
      whereas source pads are drawn on the right side of an element. In
      such graphs, data flows from left to right.

>&#13;      Pad directions are very simple compared to pad availability. A pad
      can have any of three availabilities: always, sometimes and on
      request. The meaning of those three types is exactly as it says:
      always pads always exist, sometimes pad exist only in certain
      cases (and can disappear randomly), and on-request pads appear
      only if explicitely requested by applications.

></H2
><P
>&#13;        Some elements might not have all of their pads when the element is
        created. This can happen, for example, with an Ogg demuxer element.
        The element will read the Ogg stream and create dynamic pads for
        each contained elementary stream (vorbis, theora) when it detects
        such a stream in the Ogg stream. Likewise, it will delete the pad
        when the stream ends. This principle is very useful for demuxer
        elements, for example.

        Running <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>gst-inspect oggdemux</SPAN
> will show
        that the element has only one pad: a sink pad called 'sink'. The
        other pads are <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"dormant"</SPAN
>. You can see this in the pad
        template because there is an <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Exists: Sometimes"</SPAN
>
	property. Depending on the type of Ogg file you play, the pads will
        be created. We will see that this is very important when you are
        going to create dynamic pipelines. You can attach a signal handler
        to an element to inform you when the element has created a new pad
        from one of its <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"sometimes"</SPAN
> pad templates. The
        following piece of code is an example of how to do this:

        An element can also have request pads. These pads are not created
        automatically but are only created on demand. This is very useful
        for multiplexers, aggregators and tee elements. Aggregators are
        elements that merge the content of several input streams together
        into one output stream. Tee elements are the reverse: they are
        elements that have one input stream and copy this stream to each
        of their output pads, which are created on request. Whenever an
        application needs another copy of the stream, it can simply request
        a new output pad from the tee element.

        The <CODE
CLASS="function"
>gst_element_get_request_pad ()</CODE
> method
        can be used to get a pad from the element based on the name of
        the pad template. It is also possible to request a pad that is
        compatible with another pad template. This is very useful if
        you want to link an element to a multiplexer element and you
        need to request a pad that is compatible. The method
        <CODE
CLASS="function"
>gst_element_get_compatible_pad ()</CODE
> can be
        used to request a compatible pad, as shown in the next example.
        It will request a compatible pad from an Ogg multiplexer from
        any input.
