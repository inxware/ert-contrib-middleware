>&#13;    The data flowing through a pipeline consists of a combination of
    buffers and events. Buffers contain the actual media data. Events
    contain control information, such as seeking information and
    end-of-stream notifiers. All this will flow through the pipeline
    automatically when it's running. This chapter is mostly meant to
    explain the concept to you; you don't need to do anything for this.

>&#13;      Buffers contain the data that will flow through the pipeline you have
      created. A source element will typically create a new buffer and pass
      it through a pad to the next element in the chain.  When using the
      GStreamer infrastructure to create a media pipeline you will not have
      to deal with buffers yourself; the elements will do that for you.

      A buffer consists, amongst others, of:

><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;          A pointer to a piece of memory.
        </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;          The size of the memory.
        </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;          A timestamp for the buffer.
        </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;          A refcount that indicates how many elements are using this
          buffer. This refcount will be used to destroy the buffer when no
          element has a reference to it.
        </P

>&#13;          Buffer flags.
        </P
></LI
></UL
><P
>&#13;      The simple case is that a buffer is created, memory allocated, data
      put in it, and passed to the next element.  That element reads the
      data, does something (like creating a new buffer and decoding into
      it), and unreferences the buffer.  This causes the data to be free'ed
      and the buffer to be destroyed. A typical video or audio decoder
      works like this.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      There are more complex scenarios, though. Elements can modify buffers
      in-place, i.e. without allocating a new one. Elements can also write
      to hardware memory (such as from video-capture sources) or memory
      allocated from the X-server (using XShm). Buffers can be read-only,
      and so on.
