><P
>&#13;    In <A
HREF="chapter-helloworld.html"
>Chapter 10</A
>, you've learned to build a
    simple media player for Ogg/Vorbis files. By using alternative elements,
    you are able to build media players for other media types, such as
    Ogg/Speex, MP3 or even video formats. However, you would rather want
    to build an application that can automatically detect the media type
    of a stream and automatically generate the best possible pipeline
    by looking at all available elements in a system. This process is called
    autoplugging, and <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>GStreamer</SPAN
> contains high-quality autopluggers. If
    you're looking for an autoplugger, don't read any further and go to
    <A
HREF="chapter-components.html"
>Chapter 19</A
>. This chapter will explain the
    <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>concept</I
></SPAN
> of autoplugging and typefinding. It will
    explain what systems <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>GStreamer</SPAN
> includes to dynamically detect the
    type of a media stream, and how to generate a pipeline of decoder
    elements to playback this media. The same principles can also be used
    for transcoding. Because of the full dynamicity of this concept,
    <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>GStreamer</SPAN
> can be automatically extended to support new media types
    without needing any adaptations to its autopluggers.
  </P
><P
>&#13;    We will first introduce the concept of MIME types as a dynamic and
    extendible way of identifying media streams. After that, we will introduce
    the concept of typefinding to find the type of a media stream. Lastly,
    we will explain how autoplugging and the <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>GStreamer</SPAN
> registry can be
    used to setup a pipeline that will convert media from one mimetype to
    another, for example for media decoding.

>17.1. MIME-types as a way to identity streams</A
></H1
><P
>&#13;      We have previously introduced the concept of capabilities as a way
      for elements (or, rather, pads) to agree on a media type when
      streaming data from one element to the next (see <A
HREF="section-caps.html"
>Section 8.2</A
>). We have explained that a capability is
      a combination of a mimetype and a set of properties. For most
      container formats (those are the files that you will find on your
      hard disk; Ogg, for example, is a container format), no properties
      are needed to describe the stream. Only a MIME-type is needed. A
      full list of MIME-types and accompanying properties can be found
      in <A
HREF="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/pwg/html/section-types-definitions.html"
TARGET="_top"
>the
      Plugin Writer's Guide</A
>.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      An element must associate a MIME-type to its source and sink pads
      when it is loaded into the system. <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>GStreamer</SPAN
> knows about the
      different elements and what type of data they expect and emit through
      the <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>GStreamer</SPAN
> registry. This allows for very dynamic and extensible
      element creation as we will see.

>&#13;      In <A
HREF="chapter-helloworld.html"
>Chapter 10</A
>, we've learned to build a
      music player for Ogg/Vorbis files. Let's look at the MIME-types
      associated with each pad in this pipeline. <A
HREF="chapter-autoplugging.html#section-mime-img"
>Figure 17-1</A
> shows what MIME-type belongs to each
      pad in this pipeline.
