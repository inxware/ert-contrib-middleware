>&#13;        End-of-stream events are sent if the stream that an element sends out
        is finished. An element receiving this event (from upstream, so it
        receives it on its sinkpad) will generally just process any buffered
        data (if there is any) and then forward the event further downstream.
        The <CODE
CLASS="function"
>gst_pad_event_default ()</CODE
> takes care of all
        this, so most elements do not need to support this event. Exceptions are
        elements that explicitly need to close a resource down on EOS, and
        N-to-1 elements. Note that the stream itself is <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>not</I
></SPAN
>
        a resource that should be closed down on EOS! Applications might seek
        back to a point before EOS and continue playing again.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        The EOS event has no properties, which makes it one of the simplest
        events in <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>GStreamer</SPAN

        <CODE
CLASS="function"
>gst_event_new_eos()</CODE
> function.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        It is important to note that <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>only elements driving the
        pipeline should ever send an EOS event</I
></SPAN
>. If your element
        is chain-based, it is not driving the pipeline. Chain-based elements
        should just return GST_FLOW_UNEXPECTED from their chain function at
        the end of the stream (or the configured segment), the upstream
        element that is driving the pipeline will then take care of
        sending the EOS event (or alternatively post a SEGMENT_DONE message
        on the bus depending on the mode of operation). If you are implementing
        your own source element, you also do not need to ever manually send
        an EOS event, you should also just return GST_FLOW_UNEXPECTED in
        your create function (assuming your element derives from GstBaseSrc
        or GstPushSrc).

CLASS="QUOTE"

        empty their internal list of buffers when they receive this event, for
        example. File sink elements (e.g. <SPAN

        the kernel-to-disk cache (<CODE
CLASS="function"
>fdatasync ()</CODE
> or
        <CODE
CLASS="function"
>fflush ()</CODE
>) when they receive this event. Normally,
        elements receiving this event will simply just forward it, since most
        filter or filter-like elements don't have an internal cache of data.
        <CODE
CLASS="function"
>gst_pad_event_default ()</CODE
> does just that, so for
        most elements, it is enough to forward the event using the default
        event handler.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        As a side-effect of flushing all data from the pipeline, this event
        unblocks the streaming thread by making all pads reject data until
        they receive a <A
HREF="section-events-definitions.html#section-events-flush-stop"
>Flush Stop</A

        (elements trying to push data will get a WRONG_STATE flow return
         and stop processing data).

        Like the EOS event, it has no properties. This event is usually
        only created by elements driving the pipeline, like source elements
        operating in push-mode or pull-range based demuxers/decoders.

>&#13;        The flush-stop event is sent by an element driving the pipeline
        after a flush-start and tells pads and elements downstream that
        they should accept events and buffers again (there will be at
        least a NEWSEGMENT event before any buffers first though).

>&#13;        If your element keeps temporary caches of stream data, it should

><P
>&#13;        A new segment event is sent downstream to either announce a new
        segment of data in the data stream or to update the current segment
        with new values. A new segment event must always be sent before the
        first buffer of data and after a flush (see above).
      </P
><P
>&#13;        The first new segment event is created by the element driving the 
        pipeline, like a source operating in push-mode or a demuxer/decoder
        operating pull-based. This new segment event then travels down the
        pipeline and may be transformed on the way (a decoder, for example,
        might receive a new-segment event in BYTES format and might transform
        this into a new-segment event in TIMES format based on the average
        bitrate).
      </P
><P
>&#13;        New segment events may also be used to indicate 'gaps' in the stream,
        like in a subtitle stream for example where there may not be any
        data at all for a considerable amount of (stream) time. This is done
        by updating the segment start of the current segment (see the design
        documentation for more details).
      </P
><P
>&#13;        Depending on the element type, the event can simply be forwarded using
        <CODE
CLASS="function"
>gst_pad_event_default ()</CODE
>, or it should be parsed
        and a modified event should be sent on. The last is true for demuxers,
        which generally have a byte-to-time conversion concept. Their input
        is usually byte-based, so the incoming event will have an offset in
        byte units (<CODE
CLASS="symbol"
>GST_FORMAT_BYTES</CODE
>), too. Elements
        downstream, however, expect new segment events in time units, so that
        it can be used to update the pipeline clock. Therefore, demuxers and
        similar elements should not forward the event, but parse it, free it
        and send a new newsegment event (in time units,
        <CODE
CLASS="symbol"
>GST_FORMAT_TIME</CODE
>) further downstream.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        The newsegment event is created using the function
        <CODE
CLASS="function"
>gst_event_new_new_segment ()</CODE
>. See the API
        reference and design document for details about its parameters. 
      </P
><P
>&#13;        Elements parsing this event can use gst_event_parse_new_segment_full()
        to extract the event details. Elements may find the GstSegment
        API useful to keep track of the current segment (if they want to use
        it for output clipping, for example).

>&#13;        Seek events are meant to request a new stream position to elements.
        This new position can be set in several formats (time, bytes or
        <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"default units"</SPAN
> [a term indicating frames for video,
        channel-independent samples for audio, etc.]). Seeking can be done with
        respect to the end-of-file, start-of-file or current position, and
        usually happens in upstream direction (downstream seeking is done by
        sending a NEWSEGMENT event with the appropriate offsets for elements
        that support that, like filesink).
      </P
><P
>&#13;        Elements receiving seek events should, depending on the element type,
        either just forward it upstream (filters, decoders), change the
        format in which the event is given and then forward it (demuxers),
        or handle the event by changing the file pointer in their internal
        stream resource (file sources, demuxers/decoders driving the pipeline
        in pull-mode) or something else.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        Seek events are built up using positions in specified formats (time,
        bytes, units). They are created using the function
        <CODE
CLASS="function"
>gst_event_new_seek ()</CODE
>. Note that many plugins do
        not support seeking from the end of the stream or from the current
        position. An element not driving the pipeline and forwarding a seek
        request should not assume that the seek succeeded or actually happened,
        it should operate based on the NEWSEGMENT events it receives.

        extensively in <A
