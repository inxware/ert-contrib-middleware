><P
>&#13;    Scheduling is, in short, a method for making sure that every element gets
    called once in a while to process data and prepare data for the next
    element. Likewise, a kernel has a scheduler for processes, and your
    brain is a very complex scheduler too in a way.
    Randomly calling elements' chain functions won't bring us far, however, so
    you'll understand that the schedulers in <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>GStreamer</SPAN
> are a bit more complex
    than this. However, as a start, it's a nice picture.
  </P
><P
>&#13;    So far, we have only discussed <CODE
CLASS="function"
>_chain ()</CODE
>-operating
    elements, i.e. elements that have a chain-function set on their sink pad
    and push buffers on their source pad(s). Pads (or elements) can also operate
    in two other scheduling modes, however. In this chapter, we will discuss
    what those scheduling modes are, how they can be enabled and in what
    cases they are useful. The other two scheduling modes are random access
    (<CODE
CLASS="function"
>_getrange ()</CODE
>-based) or task-runner (which means
    that this element is the driving force in the pipeline) mode.

><P
>&#13;      The stage in which <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>GStreamer</SPAN
> decides in what scheduling mode the
      various elements will operate, is called the pad-activation stage. In
      this stage, <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>GStreamer</SPAN
> will query the scheduling capabilities (i.e.
      it will see in what modes each particular element/pad can operate) and
      decide on the optimal scheduling composition for the pipeline. Next,
      each pad will be notified of the scheduling mode that was assigned to
      it, and after that the pipeline will start running.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Pads can be assigned one of three modes, each mode putting several
      prerequisites on the pads. Pads should implement a notification
      function (<CODE
CLASS="function"
>gst_pad_set_activatepull_function ()</CODE
> and
      <CODE
CLASS="function"
>gst_pad_set_activatepush_function ()</CODE
>) to be
      notified of the scheduling mode assignment. Also, sinkpads assigned
      to do pull-based scheduling mode should start and stop their task
      in this function.

>&#13;          If all pads of an element are assigned to do
          <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"push"</SPAN
>-based scheduling, then this means that data
          will be pushed by upstream elements to this element using the
          sinkpads <CODE
CLASS="function"
>_chain ()</CODE
>-function. Prerequisites
          for this scheduling mode are that a chain-function was set for
          each sinkpad using<CODE
CLASS="function"
>gst_pad_set_chain_function ()</CODE
>
          and that all downstream elements operate in the same mode. Pads are
          assigned to do push-based scheduling in sink-to-source element
          order, and within an element first sourcepads and then sinkpads.
          Sink elements can operate in this mode if their sinkpad is activated
          for push-based scheduling. Source elements cannot be chain-based.
        </P

>&#13;          Alternatively, sinkpads can be the driving force behind a pipeline
          by operating in <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"pull"</SPAN
>-based mode, while the sourcepads
          of the element still operate in push-based mode. In order to be the
          driving force, those pads start a <CODE
CLASS="classname"
>GstTask</CODE
>
          when their pads are being activated. This task is a thread, which
          will call a function specified by the element. When called, this
          function will have random data access (through
          <CODE
CLASS="function"
>gst_pad_get_range ()</CODE
>) over all sinkpads, and
          can push data over the sourcepads, which effectively means that
          this element controls data flow in the pipeline. Prerequisites for
          this mode are that all downstream elements can act in chain-based
          mode, and that all upstream elements allow random access (see below).
          Source elements can be told to act in this mode if their sourcepads
          are activated in push-based fashion. Sink elements can be told to
          act in this mode when their sinkpads are activated in pull-mode.
        </P

>&#13;          lastly, all pads in an element can be assigned to act in pull-mode.
          too. However, contrary to the above, this does not mean that they
          start a task on their own. Rather, it means that they are pull
          slave for the downstream element, and have to provide random data
          access to it from their <CODE
CLASS="function"
>_get_range ()</CODE
>-function.
          Requirements are that the a <CODE
CLASS="function"
>_get_range
          ()</CODE
>-function was set on this pad using the function
          <CODE
CLASS="function"
>gst_pad_set_getrange_function ()</CODE
>. Also, if
          the element has any sinkpads, all those pads (and thereby their
          peers) need to operate in random access mode, too. Note that the
          element is supposed to activate those elements itself! <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>GStreamer</SPAN
>
          will not do that for you.

>&#13;      In the next two sections, we will go closer into pull-based scheduling
      (elements/pads driving the pipeline, and elements/pads providing random
      access), and some specific use cases will be given.
