>Chapter 18. Pipeline manipulation</H1
><P
>&#13;    This chapter will discuss how you can manipulate your pipeline in several
    ways from your application on. Parts of this chapter are downright
    hackish, so be assured that you'll need some programming knowledge
    before you start reading this.
  </P
><P
>&#13;    Topics that will be discussed here include how you can insert data into
    a pipeline from your application, how to read data from a pipeline,
    how to manipulate the pipeline's speed, length, starting point and how
    to listen to a pipeline's data processing.

>&#13;      Probing is best envisioned as a pad listener. Technically, a probe is
      nothing more than a signal callback that can be attached to a pad.
      Those signals are by default not fired at all (since that may have a
      negative impact on performance), but can be enabled by attaching a
      probe using <CODE
CLASS="function"
>gst_pad_add_buffer_probe ()</CODE
>,
      <CODE
CLASS="function"
>gst_pad_add_event_probe ()</CODE
>, or
      <CODE
CLASS="function"
>gst_pad_add_data_probe ()</CODE
>.
      Those functions attach the signal handler and
      enable the actual signal emission. Similarly, one can use the
      <CODE
CLASS="function"
>gst_pad_remove_buffer_probe ()</CODE
>,
      <CODE
CLASS="function"
>gst_pad_remove_event_probe ()</CODE
>, or
      <CODE
CLASS="function"
>gst_pad_remove_data_probe ()</CODE
>
      to remove the signal handlers again.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Probes run in pipeline threading context, so callbacks should try to
      not block and generally not do any weird stuff, since this could
      have a negative impact on pipeline performance or, in case of bugs,
      cause deadlocks or crashes. More precisely, one should usually not
      call any GUI-related functions from within a probe callback, nor try
      to change the state of the pipeline.  An application may post custom
      messages on the pipeline's bus though to communicate with the main
      application thread and have it do things like stop the pipeline.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      In any case, most common buffer operations
      that elements can do in <CODE
CLASS="function"
>_chain ()</CODE
> functions, can
      be done in probe callbacks as well. The example below gives a short
      impression on how to use them (even if this usage is not entirely
      correct, but more on that below):

>&#13;      The above example is not really correct though.  Strictly speaking, a
      pad probe callback is only allowed to modify the buffer content if the
      buffer is writable, and it is only allowed to modify buffer metadata like
      timestamps, caps, etc. if the buffer metadata is writable.  Whether this
      is the case or not depends a lot on the pipeline and the elements
      involved.  Often enough, this is the case, but sometimes it is not,
      and if it is not then unexpected modification of the data or metadata
      can introduce bugs that are very hard to debug and track down. You can
      check if a buffer and its metadata are writable with
      <CODE
CLASS="function"
>gst_buffer_is_writable ()</CODE
> and
      <CODE
CLASS="function"
>gst_buffer_is_metadata_writable ()</CODE
>.  Since you
      can't pass back a different buffer than the one passed in, there is no
      point of making a buffer writable in the callback function.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Pad probes are suited best for looking at data as it passes through
      the pipeline. If you need to modify data, you should write your own
      GStreamer element. Base classes like GstAudioFilter, GstVideoFilter or
      GstBaseTransform make this fairly easy.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      If you just want to inspect buffers as they pass through the pipeline,
      you don't even need to set up pad probes. You could also just insert
      an identity element into the pipeline and connect to its "handoff"
      signal. The identity element also provides a few useful debugging tools
      like the "dump" property or the "last-message" property (the latter is
      enabled by passing the '-v' switch to gst-launch).
