>&#13;      Many people have expressed the wish to use their own sources to inject
      data into a pipeline. Some people have also expressed the wish to grab
      the output in a pipeline and take care of the actual output inside
      their application. While either of these methods are stongly
      discouraged, <SPAN
CLASS="application"

CLASS="emphasis"

> If it doesn't work,
      you're on your own. Also, synchronization, thread-safety and other
      things that you've been able to take for granted so far are no longer
      guaranteed if you use any of those methods. It's always better to
      simply write a plugin and have the pipeline schedule and manage it.
      See the Plugin Writer's Guide for more information on this topic. Also
      see the next section, which will explain how to embed plugins statically
      in your application.

>&#13;      New API is being developed at the moment to make data insertion and
      extraction less painful for applications. It can be found as GstAppSrc
      and GstAppSink in the gst-plugins-bad module. At the time of writing
      (October 2007), this API is not quite stable and ready yet, even though
      it may work fine for your purposes.

>&#13;      After all those disclaimers, let's start. There's three possible
      elements that you can use for the above-mentioned purposes. Those are
      called <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"fakesrc"</SPAN
> (an imaginary source),
      <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"fakesink"</SPAN
> (an imaginary sink) and <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"identity"</SPAN
>
      (an imaginary filter). The same method applies to each of those
      elements. Here, we will discuss how to use those elements to insert
      (using fakesrc) or grab (using fakesink or identity) data from a
      pipeline, and how to set negotiation.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Those who're paying close attention, will notice that the purpose
      of identity is almost identical to that of probes. Indeed, this is
      true. Probes allow for the same purpose, and a bunch more, and
      with less overhead plus dynamic removing/adding of handlers, but
      apart from those, probes and identity have the same purpose, just
      in a completely different implementation type.

>&#13;        The three before-mentioned elements (fakesrc, fakesink and identity)
        each have a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"handoff"</SPAN
> signal that will be called in
        the <CODE
CLASS="function"
>_get ()</CODE
>- (fakesrc) or <CODE
CLASS="function"
>_chain
        ()</CODE
>-function (identity, fakesink). In the signal handler,
        you can set (fakesrc) or get (identity, fakesink) data to/from the
        provided buffer. Note that in the case of fakesrc, you have to set
        the size of the provided buffer using the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"sizemax"</SPAN
>
        property. For both fakesrc and fakesink, you also have to set the
        <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"signal-handoffs"</SPAN
> property for this method to work.

        block, since this will block pipeline iteration. Also, do not try
        to use all sort of weird hacks in such functions to accomplish
        something that looks like synchronization or so; it's not the right
        way and will lead to issues elsewhere. If you're doing any of this,
        you're basically misunderstanding the <SPAN

>&#13;        Sometimes, when using fakesrc as a source in your pipeline, you'll
        want to set a specific format, for example a video size and format
        or an audio bitsize and number of channels. You can do this by
        forcing a specific <CODE
CLASS="classname"
>GstCaps</CODE
> on the pipeline,
        which is possible by using <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>filtered caps</I
></SPAN
>. You
        can set a filtered caps on a link by using the
        <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"capsfilter"</SPAN
> element in between the two elements, and
        specifying a <CODE
CLASS="classname"
>GstCaps</CODE
> as
        <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"caps"</SPAN
> property on this element. It will then
        only allow types matching that specified capability set for
        negotiation.

        every second) video to an X-window output by using fakesrc as a
        source and using filtered caps to force a format. Since the depth
        of the image depends on your X-server settings, we use a colorspace
        conversion element to make sure that the output to your X server
        will have the correct bitdepth. You can also set timestamps on the
        provided buffers to override the fixed framerate.
