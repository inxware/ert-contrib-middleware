Welcome to JACK, the Jack Audio Connection Kit.

Please see the website (http://jackit.sf.net/) for more information.

NOTE: If you are using reiserfs or ext3fs or anything except ext2fs
for the directory where JACK puts its temporary files (/tmp by
default), then the JACK team recommends that you do *one* of the 
following:

----------------------------

Mount a tmpfs on /tmp.  You should have a lot of swap space available
in case some programs try to write very large files there.
In your /etc/fstab add a line:

   none        /tmp    tmpfs   defaults        0       0

 You'll probably want to reboot here, or kill X then 'mount /tmp'.

---- OR ----

Alternatively, you can do this without affecting your /tmp:

# mkdir /mnt/ramfs

[edit /etc/fstab and add the following line]
 none       /mnt/ramfs      tmpfs      defaults  0 0

Then add --with-default-tmpdir=/mnt/ramfs to the JACK configure
line when you build it.  No clients need to be recompiled.

------------------------------

Failure to do one of these could lead to extremely poor performance from JACK,
since its normal operation will cause bursts of disk I/O that are
completely unnecessary. This suggestion can also be used by ext2fs
users if they wish.
