Description: Development files for Avahi's embeddable mDNS/DNS-SD library
 Avahi is a fully LGPL framework for Multicast DNS Service Discovery.
 It allows programs to publish and discover services and hosts
 running on a local network with no specific configuration. For
 example you can plug into a network and instantly find printers to
 print to, files to look at and people to talk to.
 .
 This package contains the development files for Avahi's embeddable
 mDNS/DNS-SD stack. This can be used by embedded application developers
 to integrate mDNS/DNS-SD functionality into their applications.
 .
 You should not however use this library for non-embedded applications, you
 shoudl use libavahi-client-dev which interacts with the avahi daemon.
