Description: Python utility package for Avahi
 Avahi is a fully LGPL framework for Multicast DNS Service Discovery.

 example you can plug into a network and instantly find printers to
 print to, files to look at and people to talk to.
 .
 This package contains utility modules to talk to Avahi with Python easier.
