Description: Avahi Qt 4 integration library
 Avahi is a fully LGPL framework for Multicast DNS Service Discovery.
 It allows programs to publish and discover services and hosts
 running on a local network with no specific configuration. For
 example you can plug into a network and instantly find printers to
 print to, files to look at and people to talk to.
 .
 This library contains the interface to integrate the Avahi libraries
 into a Qt 4 main loop application.
