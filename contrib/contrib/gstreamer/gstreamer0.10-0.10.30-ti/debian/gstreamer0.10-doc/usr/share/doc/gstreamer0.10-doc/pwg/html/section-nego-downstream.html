>&#13;      Downstream negotiation takes place when a format needs to be set on a
      source pad to configure the output format, but this element allows
      renegotiation because its format is configured on the sinkpad caps,
      or because it supports multiple formats. The requirements for doing
      the actual negotiation differ slightly.

>&#13;        Many elements, particularly effects and converters, will be able
        to parse the format of the stream from their input caps, and decide
        the output format right at that time already. When renegotiation
        takes place, some may merely need to "forward" the renegotiation
        backwards upstream (more on that later). For those elements, all
        (downstream) caps negotiation can be done in something that we
        call the <CODE
CLASS="function"
>_setcaps ()</CODE
> function. This function is
        called when a buffer is pushed over a pad, but the format on this
        buffer is not the same as the format that was previously negotiated
        (or, similarly, no format was negotiated yet so far).
      </P
><P
>&#13;        In the <CODE
CLASS="function"
>_setcaps ()</CODE
>-function, the element can
        forward the caps to the next element and, if that pad accepts the
        format too, the element can parse the relevant parameters from the
        caps and configure itself internally. The caps passed to this function
        is <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>always</I
></SPAN
> a subset of the template caps, so
        there's no need for extensive safety checking. The following example
        should give a clear indication of how such a function can be
        implemented:
      </P

CLASS="programlisting"

static gboolean
gst_my_filter_setcaps (GstPad  *pad,
		       GstCaps *caps)

  GstMyFilter *filter = GST_MY_FILTER (GST_OBJECT_PARENT (pad));
  GstStructure *s;

  /* forward-negotiate */
  if (!gst_pad_set_caps (filter-&#62;srcpad, caps))
    return FALSE;

  /* negotiation succeeded, so now configure ourselves */
  s = gst_caps_get_structure (caps, 0);

>&#13;        There may also be cases where the filter actually is able to
        <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>change</I
></SPAN
> the format of the stream. In those cases,
        it will negotiate a new format. Obviously, the element should first
        attempt to configure <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"pass-through"</SPAN
>, which means that
        it does not change the stream's format. However, if that fails,
        then it should call <CODE
CLASS="function"
>gst_pad_get_allowed_caps ()</CODE
>
        on its sourcepad to get a list of supported formats on the outputs,
        and pick the first. The return value of that function is guaranteed
        to be a subset of the template caps.
      </P

        samplerates, so where input and output samplerate don't have to be

></H2
><P
>&#13;        Other elements, such as certain types of decoders, will not be able
        to parse the caps from their input, simply because the input format
        does not contain the information required to know the output format
        yet; rather, the data headers need to be parsed, too. In many cases,
        fixed-caps will be enough, but in some cases, particularly in cases
        where such decoders are renegotiable, it is also possible to use
        full caps negotiation.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        Fortunately, the code required to do so is very similar to the last
        code example in <A
HREF="section-nego-downstream.html#section-nego-downstream-embed"
>Negotiating caps embedded in input caps</A
>, with
        the difference being that the caps is selected in the <CODE
CLASS="function"
>_chain
        ()</CODE
>-function rather than in the <CODE
CLASS="function"
>_setcaps
        ()</CODE
>-function. The rest, as for getting all allowed caps from
        the source pad, fixating and such, is all the same. Re-negotiation,
        which will be handled in the next section, is very different for such
        elements, though.
