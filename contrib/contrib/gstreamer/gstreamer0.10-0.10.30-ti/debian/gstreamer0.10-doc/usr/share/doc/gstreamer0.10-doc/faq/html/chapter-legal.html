>&#13;This part of the FAQ is based on a series of questions we asked the FSF
to understand how the GPL works and how patents affects the GPL. These
questions were answered by the <A

final interpretation on how the GPL and LGPL interact with patents in our

This would be a problem, because the GStreamer and MyPlayer licenses would
forbid it.  In order to link GStreamer to MyPlayer, you need to use section
3 of the LGPL to convert GStreamer to GPL.  The GPL version of GStreamer
forbids linking to the Sorenson decoder.  Anyway, the MyPlayer GPL
license forbids this.  
        </P
><P
>&#13;If the authors of MyPlayer want to permit this, we have an
exception for them: the controlled interface exception from the FAQ.
The idea of this is that you can't get around the GPL just by including
a LGPL bit in the middle.

You may not distribute the plug-in with the GPL application. 
Distributing the plug-in alone, with the knowledge that it will be used
primarily by GPL software is a bit of an edge case.  We will not advise you
that it would be safe to do so, but we also will not advise you that it
would be absolutely forbidden.

This might infringe some patents, but the GPL would not forbid it 
absent some actual restriction, such as a court judgement or agreement.
The US government is empowered to refuse importation of patent
infringing devices, including software.

handle media codecs which have patents.  Take mad, an mp3 decoding library,
as an example.  It is licensed under the GPL. In countries where patents

The mere existence of a patent which might read on the program does not
change anything. However, if a court judgement or other agreement
prevents you from distributing libmad under GPL terms, you can not
distribute it at all.
        </P
><P
>&#13;The GPL and LGPL say (sections 7 and 11):
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your
obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then
as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all."</SPAN

So let's say there is a court judgement. Does this mean that the GPL license is
invalid for the project everywhere, or only in the countries where it conflicts
with the applicable patents ?

The GPL operates on a per-action, not per-program basis.  That is, if
you are in a country which has software patents, and a court tells you
that you cannot distribute (say) libmad in source code form, then you
cannot distribute libmad at all.  This doesn't affect anyone else.

Patented decoding can be implemented in GStreamer either by
having a binary-only plugin do the decoding, or by writing a plugin
(with any applicable license) that links to a binary-only library.

Is it correct that you cannot distribute the GPL mad library to
decode mp3's, *even* in the case where you have obtained a valid license 
for decoding mp3 ?

CLASS="answer"

><B

The only GPL-compatible patent licenses are those which are open to  
all parties posessing copies of GPL software which practices the 
teachings of the patent.
        </P
><P
>&#13;If you take a license which doesn't allow others to distribute
original or modified versions of libmad practicing the same patent
claims as the version you distribute, then you may not distribute at
all.
