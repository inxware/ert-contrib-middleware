>&#13;      In the previous part, particularly <A
HREF="section-scheduling-randomxs.html"
>Providing random access</A
>, we have learned that some types
      of elements can provide random access. This applies most definitely to
      source elements reading from a randomly seekable location, such as file
      sources. However, other source elements may be better described as a
      live source element, such as a camera source, an audio card source and
      such; those are not seekable and do not provide byte-exact access. For
      all such use cases, <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>GStreamer</SPAN
> provides two base classes:
      <CODE
CLASS="classname"
>GstBaseSrc</CODE
> for the basic source functionality, and
      <CODE
CLASS="classname"
>GstPushSrc</CODE
>, which is a non-byte exact source
      base-class. The pushsource base class itself derives from basesource as
      well, and thus all statements about the basesource apply to the
      pushsource, too.
    </P

      so they no longer have to worry about it:

          multiple sourcepads cannot use this base-class.
        </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;          Since the base-class owns the pad and derived classes can only
          control it as far as the virtual functions allow, you are limited
          to the functionality provided by the virtual functions. If you need
          more, you cannot use this base-class.

>&#13;      It is possible to use special memory, such as X server memory pointers
      or <CODE
CLASS="function"
>mmap ()</CODE
>'ed memory areas, as data pointers in
      buffers returned from the <CODE
CLASS="function"
>create()</CODE
> virtual function.
      In almost all cases, you will want to subclass
      <CODE
CLASS="classname"
>GstBuffer</CODE
> so that your own set of functions can
      be called when the buffer is destroyed.

>&#13;        An audio source is nothing more but a special case of a pushsource.
        Audio sources would be anything that reads audio, such as a source
        reading from a soundserver, a kernel interface (such as ALSA) or a
        test sound / signal generator. <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>GStreamer</SPAN
> provides two base classes,
        similar to the two audiosinks described in <A
HREF="chapter-other-base.html#section-base-audiosink"
>Writing an audio sink</A
>; one is ringbuffer-based, and
        requires the derived class to take care of its own scheduling,
        synchronization and such. The other is based on this
        <CODE
CLASS="classname"
>GstBaseAudioSrc</CODE
> and is called
        <CODE
CLASS="classname"
>GstAudioSrc</CODE
>, and provides a simple
        <CODE
CLASS="function"
>open ()</CODE
>, <CODE
CLASS="function"
>close ()</CODE
> and
        <CODE
CLASS="function"
>read ()</CODE
> interface, which is rather simple to
        implement and will suffice for most soundserver sources and audio
        interfaces (e.g. ALSA or OSS) out there.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        The <CODE
CLASS="classname"
>GstAudioSrc</CODE
> base-class has several benefits
        for derived classes, on top of the benefits of the
        <CODE
CLASS="classname"
>GstPushSrc</CODE
> base-class that it is based on:
