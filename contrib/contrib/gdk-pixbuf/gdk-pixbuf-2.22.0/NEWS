2.21.3
======

gdk-pixbuf has been turned back into a standalone library, after being
shipped as part of GTK+ for a number of years. The changes in this
version, compared to the version included in GTK+ 2.20 are the following:

* The default location for loaders has been changed to
  $libdir/gdk-pixbuf-2.0/2.10.0/loaders

* The default location for the module file has been changed to
  $libdir/gdk-pixbuf-2.0/2.10.0/loaders.cache
  and gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders-2.0 will update that file when given
  the --update-cache option.
